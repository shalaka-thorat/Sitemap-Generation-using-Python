    "\n",
    "1) \\<urlset> (Required Tag): This is main parent tag of the file which contains information related to all the URLs. It has an attribute 'xmlns' which defines the schema of the sitemap.<br>\n",

    "        \n",

    "2) \\<url> (Required Tag): This is child tag of \\<urlset> and is responsible for each URL entry. Further explained tags are child tags of \\<url> tag.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3) \\<loc> (Required Tag): This includes URL of the page. It must begin with the protocol like http or https, and end with a trailing slash (/). The URLs must be unique, there should not be any duplicate entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) \\<lastmod> (Optional Tag): This value specifies the last modified date of the page. This date should be in YYYY-MM-DD format. This date should resemble the date on last modification was done to the page, and not the creation date of sitemap.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) \\<changefreq> (Optional Tag): This indicates about how frequently the page is likely to modify. This value provides information about how often search engines should crawl the page. Valid values are: always, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, never\n",
    "\n",
    "6) \\<priority> (Optional Tag): The priority of URL is a measure of how important this page is relative to other URLs on the website. This value should be between 0.0 to 1.0. The default priority of a page is 0.5. For example, if URL is of homepage, then priority must be 1.0.\n",

    "#### How to construct Sitemap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the steps through which you can construct a sitemap for your website:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Collection of URLs to be included for the sitemap: This includes collecting the URLs which are essential for building sitemap. These might be stored in a database and retrieved. Here, in <i>Part 1</i> of this notebook, we do web-scraping for a single page for demostration purpose. We pre-process all the URLs that are retrieved and store these unique URLs in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Creating Sitemap for URLs: From the URLs we stored in Part 1, we construct the sitemap. Depending on the number of URLs, we need to create sitemaps. A sitemap can include <i>Maximum 50,000 URL entries</i> and size of sitemap must be <i>less than 50 MB</i>. This procedure has been explained in <i>Part 2</i> of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Creation of Sitemap Index: If there are multiple sitemap files created, then you can enlist each entry into a Sitemap Index file. A Sitemap Index can include <i>maximum 50,000 Sitemap entries</i> and size of Sitemap Index must be <i>less than 50 MB</i>. There can be more than 1 Sitemap Index file. XML Format of Sitemap Index file is similar to Sitemap. You will get a detailed view of this in notebook <i>Part 2</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each URL entry must be unique in a Sitemap, and each Sitemap entry must be unique in Sitemap Index.\n",
    "\n",

    "1) Issue: There were some URLs having only / <br>\n",

    "Solution: URLs must be cleaned, with no ? symbols, remove the latter part after ?, just keep the actual valid URLs\n",

    "7) Issue: Udemy has its own sitemap, and we have obtained that link as well while scraping URLs <br>\n",

    "    \n",
    "1) It must be a valid URL that starts with http or https and should have a proper domain, which covers Issues 1 and 3. <br>All the URLs of a specific sitemap must have the same domain as that of the sitemap. Like if sitemap is located on \"https://www.abc.com/sitemap.xml\", then URL entries contained in that sitemap must have their domain as \"https://wwww.abc.com/ \" which is issue 6. <br>So for handling all these issues, we have prepended BASE_URL i.e. Udemy domain. Also URLs that already have some domain other than BASE_URL are removed as these don't match the same domain.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) The URL must have a trailing slash, which is our issue 4 and it should have no arguments, which covers our issue 2. So we have added a trailing slash to URLs and removed the arguments (? part in URL).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) We need unique URL entries for a sitemap, which handles issue 5. Udemy has its own sitemap entry, and we don't include sitemap entry in a sitemap. So the URL conatining sitemap entry is removed, which solves our issue 7."
